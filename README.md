# onnx2hef_hailo8l-8

## Overview

A set of Python scripts to **convert ONNX deep learning models into Hailo HEF format** for deployment on Hailo-8L accelerators. This project includes parsing, optimizing, and compiling steps for preparing models (e.g., from YOLO/Ultralytics) to Hailo deployable binaries.

Hailo’s HEF format enables efficient inference on Hailo-8L hardware. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
